Edge Cases:
 - Empty file provided.
 - File contains characters, but no words.
 - Last character in file is the end of a word.
     + I chose to make my program add a single whitespace to the end of the input
     eliminating the possibility that this edge case will occur.
 - Last character in file is a non-word character.
 - Is it possible the the input file could be too big?
